# European Union Lung Cancer Analysis Project
This repository contains my Python code for a student project I completed whilst studying at CareerFoundry. This project lead to the development of a Tableau Storyboard detailing insights about Lung Cancer incidence and survival across EU countries. Python scripts have also been included to document the various analyses run on the data.

## Project Context:
In the EU, Lung Cancer is estimated to account for 20.4% of all deaths due to cancer, making it the leading cause of cancer death in men and second in women. Analysing demographic, biological, behavioural, and treatment-related factors in lung cancer patients can contribute to developing cancer-risk prediction models and support decisions regarding appropriate treatment.

## Key Questions and Objectives:
This analysis attempts to answer the following questions:

● Which health indicators are most strongly associated with lung cancer survival?

● Which countries in the European Union have the highest survival rate of lung cancer? why might some countries' survival rates be ahead of others?

● Can a predictive model be developed to determine an individual's likelihood of surviving lung cancer based on health indicators, treatment, and/or demographic variables?

## Data:
Lung cancer mortality data was sourced from **Kaggle**. The data itself is artificially generated and little is known about what it is based on. This limitation is noted in the final storyboard. Use this link to look up the data card on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masterdatasan/lung-cancer-mortality-datasets-v2/data

## Tools Used:

● **Python:** Scripts were written in Jupyter notebook to conduct data cleaning, data wrangling, and various analyses to uncover relationships and patterns within the data.

● **Tableau Public:** Tableau was utilised to illustrate and report on findings made throughout the project. Key insights, limitations, and future steps have been detaled in the conclusion.

● **Excel:** On occasion, Excel was utilised to wrangle the data and simplify the process of creating certain visualisations in Tableau.
